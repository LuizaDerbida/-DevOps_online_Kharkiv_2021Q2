I learned how to work with git using commands like this  
git config --global - git setup  
git add - adds new information  
git status - shows repository branch data  
git commit - write changes to repo  
git init - create repository  
git clone - clone a repository  
git checkout - switch between branches  
git branch - create branches  
git merge - merge branches
